i ve had this thermometer for about num_num years . 
this product does what it is suppose to do . 
i purchased this filter for a braun num_extend coffeemaker . 
very good price but this one harder to use than my cusinart . 
so ,  to me this is pretty darn  instant  . 
replaced my pampered chef garlic press with this one . 
i use this as a little office supply shelf . 
durable and seems similar quality to apple products . 
i have many oxo products ,  and i ve always been pleased . 
i also prefered the blade weight and thickness of the wustof . 
make sure the pins line up with the contacts . 
it turned out just fine to replace what i had lost . 
love the way these roll instead of sliding on the rod . 
product arrived on time and was wrapped well . 
i had it a long time now and i still love it . 
this offers really good protection for the phone . 
this is one of the best vacuums i ve ever come across . 
one minute per slice seems like a good rule of thumb so far . 
the metal is very sturdy and the non stick finish is great . 
the flap also is good and does not come loose at all . 
sharp cutting edges make your pies look as good as they taste . 
i m a male ,  a bachelor who lives alone . 
recently threw in the trash as the line wore out . 
i have several of these ,  well worth it . 
i would recommend to anyone who wants a pda . 
i believe it was about $ when it came to market . 
great charger ,  though there may be cheaper options . 
the whole thing gets hot when you use it . 
so shipping takes a while but it is definitely worth the price . 
blocking the red hot coils from my cookie sheets ,  and glassware . 
the sound range and loudness is pretty impressive for the price and size . 
great for about anything you want to shred ,  cut or mix . 
order it with something else ,  and you ll get free shipping . 
i don t think pie weights are for me . 
the head set is quite comfortable  at least for me  . 
washing it is a breeze and just takes a second . 
once glitch ,  which i did not view as all that negative . 
i have had this mount for about a year and it works great . 
this happened after about num_num years of use . 
but it s not bad for wireless ,  i ve had worse . 
exactly what i need for my phone and at the best price possible . 
shipped free directly from realook and arrived within two days . 
easy to put on and i have no problems . 
i think that is the way to keep the fish moist . 
it was just one and that s not a big deal . 
i haven t had any problems with teflon flaking off . 
i only wish the vacuum head was a little larger . 
i like almost everything except cucumber juice  echhh  . 
one great feature is that the spatula head is removable for east cleaning . 
auto shut off after num_num hours ,  which is a good feature . 
i bought this in num_num and the pan is still in great shape . 
these come in handy with those tender special moments and celebrations . 
and yet it is compact and not too heavy . 
both english and metric measurements are embossed onto each spoon . 
and it ll keep rice perfect and hot for up to num_num hours . 
the copper finish is coated with a clear plastic to prevent oxidation . 
it keeps the air clean and nice fresh smelling . 
belt works fine and installed in just a few minutes . 
obviously the margin of safety  from overflow  is much smaller . 
i paid $ for this when i bought a few other pieces . 
i would buy again if the shipping wasnt so long . 
so far has lasted for a long time and does not wear off . 
the only thing is it stretches easily so be careful with that . 
this will compete with any top of the line knife you can buy . 
dash mounts are either bulky and in the way or not strong enough . 
i bought this protective cover case for num_num cents plus shipping . 
mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary . 
very sturdy with a good selection of teeth sizes . 
it s more powerful so i expect it to be a little louder . 
the handle is comfortable and holds the pitchers securely in your hands . 
that said ,  the mic did pic up everything it could . 
i just bought a num_extend cubic ft chest freezer . 
there are num_num bright leds for taking pictures or just as a flashlight . 
no more oil on my hands when cooking up a steak or falafel . 
it works great and i am very happy with it . 
the shipping charges are now lower and upfront on the order . 
i bought it for a new iphone num_extend
i can t believe how beautiful and substantial this ice cream maker is . 
this one does the job i need it for !  . 
i don t want the bulk of an otterbox defender . 
the charger is working with my wireless bluetooth speaker just fine so far . 
i m starting to hate it because i don t need to upgrade . 
i guess you could say so what it s a ladle . 
fast; better than a blender and is easy to use . 
overall i love them ,  and would probably buy them again . 
i have two of them in different locations in my house . 
the voice from the earpiece says  connected  on successful completion . 
they come with full instructions and not much more to say . 
went looking for them and you had them . 
i have been extremely happy with my purchase . 
the glass cuisinart lids would pour water everywhere in a wet mess . 
comes with a  towel  to clean the phone before placement . 
no battery to wear out and have to replace . 
like i said ,  it works ,  these are ok . 
this gets the job done for the price . 
seems to working fine in my mother s humidifier . 
mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook . 
it pushed right through the job with no trouble . 
on the other hand for power grating you ve got something here . 
the remaining sticker is attached to the second film . 
i use it for my line of work and it stands up . 
the cheese came out light and fluffy wished i had had one earlier . 
great headset ,  solid build quality and blocks out the wind . 
one corner is slightly taller than the other but its hardly noticeable . 
i am so glad we chose this one . 
we use these alot and they work great . 
i say that after trying many cheap pathetic headsets ,  sigh . 
i pretreated the worst stains withwoolite pet stain . 
i have dropped the phone onto a tile floor and it is fine . 
the la prima ran about half a shot then choked the machine . 
with medium usage its closer to about num_num hours . 
the bottom most container is not as small as one would think . 
that s what it does and it does it well . 
however ,  this is an example of how rosle got it right . 
it fulfills my modest requirements ,  and exceeds my expectations in appearance . 
some reviewers complained of grounds in the coffee . 
i had installed two of these for the front entrance of our house . 
look up videos on swype if you want to see it in action . 
i like that is is durable and washable . 
the aluminum ones get stained and ugly after a few uses . 
adds some bulk to phone but not a large amount . 
place it in the freezer and close the door . 
open carefully and handle the zippers with care . 
it had a great cost and a great product . 
these type honeywells have been around a long time . 
i have had no problem with either piece and highly recommend the products . 
it stays stable in your ear very nicely and is surprisingly very comfortable . 
this little butter bell is a fantastic buy . 
this headset is awesome ,  the sound quality is truly amazing . 
nothing bad to say about this wonderful innovation at all . 
it stay clean and does not collect food stains . 
i never have problems answering the phone this way with my blackberry . 
easy to apply and it works very well . 
i wore my first one out by pouring hot gravies in it . 
also ,  don t use that yellow cloth to clean your phone . 
the cord is extra heavy to resist tangling . 
i purchased these batteries based on the reviews of others . 
doesn t really reduce the fat anymore than most cooking methods . 
the cookbook that comes with it is adequate . 
sometimes i m there for up to num_num hours . 
it has a num_num year warranty on defects too . 
this cover does exactly what it is designed to do . 
easily moved to various locations depending on need . 
i have read reviews from wine experts that it doesn t work . 
when purchased i discovered there was a newer product update :  model num_extend
i just got this and recently got a chance to use it . 
then along came this zester which i use constantly . 
i purchased it from one of the first  infomercials  . 
i recommand smaller size for everyday use . but i like this pan . 
toasts bread ,  muffins and bagels with lots of options to choose . 
tastes in between the classic american blonde ale and cowboy golden lager . 
i purchased the screen protectors for my evo . 
put homemade pizza sauce on top then add pepperoni and fresh mushrooms . 
this is the old faithful water filter pitcher . 
i shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future . 
would be five stars if it was out of slightly heavier material . 
i ve been happy with most oxo products i ve purchased . 
it s good to go the next morning ,  completely clean . 
other than that small problem ,  this is a great bt headdest . 
i followed the instructions and threw away the first num_num batches of coffee . 
loved the deffender case hated the apple phone . 
it can t be tightened at that point to fix it . 
wrapped around me easily to tuck in for getting ready at the gym . 
so i purchased another knife sharpener for this our num_num yankee swap . 
blade release buttons are simple to use which makes cleaning easy . 
i ordered it and it was delivered well in time . 
i bought this is a gift for my brother . 
 : pi also have limited space in my kitchen . 
wish it had a crank or something to make it easier . 
i also love it because the jar is plastic . 
delicious over fruit and kashii go lean crunch cereal . 
you ve probably seen them use it on iron chef . 
i think that dsp manager is the stock one for android phones . 
i purchased this to replace a knife that was lost . 
it would have been perfect if it was a tad bit smaller . 
all came well sharpened and ready to go . 
i have had two of these cans outside for over a year . 
i ve tried the pulls with prongs that go along side the cork . 
games like gem journey are easier to play with a stylus like this . 
it is great if you have more than one guest to serve . 
i made beef bolognese in the oven and it turned out wonderfully . 
i got this as a gift for my son . 
i think this size wont do a bigger bird than num_num pounds . 
making seperation and cross contamination containment a very easy . 
i cannot wait to show it off ! thank you !  . 
the measuring spoons would make a great stocking stuffer for any kitchen queen . 
the zester was easy enough to clean after use . 
but for now ,  i m quite happy with this . 
perfect size for preparing dishes . it really works well . 
 the last time i did it was a year ago  . 
this product is being used for dollar size pancakes . 
the tiny green light on one side is very bright when fully charged . 
apparently there are thirteen more words required to successfully submit this review . 
love it !  really handy to set by the stove . 
adequately long cord . made in china ,  hence no reliability . 
but this one does the job very nicely . 
i m a fan of symbian and find it easy to operate . 
plugs the ipad into my car and works great . 
i m convinced vacuum sealing works just as advertised . 
i like it better than any of the forman items . 
i use this thing to core out the inside of a potato . 
once it dies i will purchase a better unit . 
this style of meat pounder is sort of commodity like . 
nice not to have a burner going for hours . 
i can t believe i haven t owned one of these before . 
this unit makes the best french fries i ve ever made . 
it works with all types ,  but works best with roma tomatoes . 
careful when using steak knives however because they will scratch these plates . 
just wipe the plates with a paper towel . 
i can t believe that i didn t buy these sooner . 
the recipe that comes with it is tasty . 
it s still going great ,  i just needed more capacity . 
also ,  the knife is easy to maneuver despite its length . 
i have no doubt that it will hold up well through the years . 
i had two problems ,  one caused the rating to num_num num_extend
it stays on and i unplug it when it s done . 
for the price ,  this is a good buy . 
and it s a bread knife and nothing all that special . 
no need to find storage place because it fits in any shallow drawer . 
then both of them go into the dishwasher . 
i love my lodge omelet pan and use it almost every morning . 
tablets charge slowly ,  but that s to be expected . 
this pan i have had for one year . 
i do seem to need to invest in some better popcorn . 
bento spoon and the boker knife which is quite nice . 
really confused ppl riding with me at first . 
i finally made he purchase and am glad i did . 
i can t remember when i first bought this timer . 
it does not slip all over the place when using . 
coming from an asian background it s not something we normally cook with . 
it should reconnect easily when you are in the num_extend
now i just need to buy a catch can for the bottle tops . 
i have had to replace the paddles as they wore out . 
i liked this and was happy with my purchase . 
we juiced our garden lettuce and greens with ease . 
anyway i recommend this one for its price and quality . 
i put my kitchen appliances through the ringer . 
i have been missing out !  this thing is so sharp . 
it is easy to clean ,  but honestly i rarely clean it . 
you have to break it in ,  in other words . 
the price was good ,  and came quickly though my prime membership . 
for my purpose this is the perfect item . 
we both use the blackberry num_num curve ,  which each use bluetooth version num_extend
great case ,  easy to use and very durable . 
need a cheap car charger and it seems to do the job . 
have been using it daily since it arrived . 
i have both a square and round pan i use this with . 
i have never had a pleasant experience with the customer support at cuisnart . 
much to my dismay ,  the invisishield was nothing but garbage . 
it creates heaping folds of foam andturns your coffee into a breve latte . 
i though it would be faster and easier but it wasn t . 
it seems to be of very good quality in its build . 
i have smaller bt headsets that last num_num hours longer . 
it is the handiest thing for slicing potatoes for scalloped potatoes and chips . 
i have been using one for nearly num_num years . 
researched before i bought it and had actually chosen another one . 
it keeps it the coffee hot and fresh for hours . 
i followed the guidance and am grateful for it . 
in particular ,  the coating on this cookware has been cheapened . 
fits perfectly ,  cutouts are plsced where they should be . 
i ve only charged it once since i bought it . 
i also like the adjustable heat option for the warming plate . 
i still have privacy screen ,  after num_num months . 
it it pretty hardy ,  i haven t broken it yet . 
i will update my review after num_num months . 
i purchased two to mount horizontally under the shelves of my kitchen island . 
also cheaper than going to the grocery store . 
no complaints and my wife loves the color . 
i m not sure why this grinder got so many mixed reviews . 
these small cookie scoops made perfectly uniform two inch cookies . 
voice command is better on this set than other ones i ve tried . 
these tongs seem to have the locking mechanism backwards . 
get it ,  it s worth the price for sure . 
things i notice so far : + bluetooth num_extend streaming is solid . 
fasy to keep clean and a real treasure . 
just make sure that you don t misplace the spout stopper . 
i received them as a christmas present and i love them . 
it did what it was supposed to do . 
put num_num quart of water into the machine . 
this keeps the cord out of the way and above the board . 
i use is for more than deep frying . 
i sprinkle a little flour on the rolls before stamping to prevent sticking . 
it was the finger next to his hole finger . 
we are ice cream lovers and fussy about the quality of ice cream . 
also these attachment pieces are very easy to clean . 
only negative was delifery was num_num days late . 
i just received a replacement bb curve from verizon . 
oh ,  and the battery life is pretty decent . 
i dropped phone once and the case held up perfectly . 
i installed this on a horizantaly sliding window . 
these wine stoppers are very inexpensive and certainly do the job . 
glad i went for this one over some of the less expensive ones . 
cleans up nice and cooks waffles in a reasonable amount of time . 
then into my phone and it chargers my phone . 
the otterbox defender series is by far the best available . 
this turner has worked well for the last few years . 
i have not been able to stop using it . 
however ,  slicing up tons of veggies can be quite time consuming . 
i mainly use my blentec now but haven t sold the vitamix yet . 
i was glad to see it was still available . 
very easy to put on ,  no bubbles whatsoever . 
i can see i will be using it a lot . 
i was concerned for the price that these measuring cups would be flimsy . 
the complication is the heft of the phone . 
i have owned it for two years and it is a work horse . 
you place all the ingredients into the bread maker . 
my dish feels very solid to the touch . 
this is definitely not the case with the num_extend
i don t know how i ever managed without this handy devise . 
but these knives are well worth their price . 
the loops stop any accidently lost or intentional disappearance . 
we usually run it on low and it is relatively quite . 
it charges my phone very quickly and to full % battery . 
well worth the money ,  wouldn t want to be without it . 
i will never have a phone without an otterbox again . 
then i thought something was wrong with my car . 
that is sufficiently minor as to not affect my rating . 
because it s made of cast iron ,  scorching is minimized . 
very nice unit ,  easy to assemble and operate . 
simple !  does the job it was intended for . 
item arrived in num_num days in bulk packaging exactly like j . 
for the size ,  weight and price it is really worth it . 
i just flipped the pan over ,  and there they were . 
it holds the charge like when my phone was brand new . 
i would recommend this case to my friends . 
the same panel buttons are there but in a better placement . 
all my testing proves the same . hope that helps . 
all in all ,  though ,  happy with the product . 
finish is great ,  and it makes great french toast . 
they get into the corners as described and are flexible yet firm . 
i have had mine for almost two years and they have not frayed . 
with grandchildren ,  this is the perfect combination of colorful and functional . 
it s also a good size for a family of num_extend
i could not tell a difference at all . 
i have been using this grill for num_num years . 
i would not suggest this on black iphones . 
it is close to the old one i had for years . 
one to another company and two to amazon . com . 
the knife got a tad rusty after running it through a cycle . 
i think the sensor is reading carpet fibers its sucking up as dirt . 
no problems with this and worked with many devices . 
either you will like it ,  or you won t . 
puts together very easily and does what it s said it would . 
trash cans are pretty unexciting ,  but this one is awfully nice . 
much better than block and tackle type hooks to store overhead . 
it is not difficult to clean or assemble . 
this pan is a bit heavier and truly nonstick . 
i can hear the caller clearly ,  vice versa . 
only issue is the blue light it becomes a annoying after a while . 
we have tried a few recipes and had fun with them . 
take the whole thing out in the sink . 
this salad spinner is durable and easy to use . 
it s very easy to use and very dependable . 
it moves plenty of air ,  oscillating between two rooms . 
i ve owned this crock pot for several years . 
if you want loud get the cdn num_extend count down big digit timer . 
then i used the attachemnts on my furniture and the water was gray . 
i think this case is a very nice phone case . 
anker is a fine product though i d never heard of it . 
the unit itself rests like a necklace around your neck . 
the item was what i was looking for and arrived exactly as described . 
the braun has it all . this is my second programmable flavorselect . 
i would definitely recommend this for a cute case . 
but the back side looks nice as well . 
i bought three of these units to place in our home . 
and that would be what you would need . 
it works fine and the coffee is just as great !  . 
it basically picks up what is directly in front of it . 
pretty much all i ask for in a grinder . 
it s a very good quality at a reasonalbe price . 
just do your homework and you will end up pretty satisfied . 
this knife sharpener more than met our expectations . 
most pizza wheels that i ve seen are much smaller . 
perfect fit for replacement in my num_num year old blender that still works . 
and i have tried a lot of them . 
i give it five stars for making eating good so easy !  . 
i can t believe how strong this little guy is . 
the daily challenge around here is keeping the cat fur to a minimum . 
despite the port breaking it gets num_extend stars . 
synching is simple ,  with no passwords or codes required . 
wow im impressed with this device !  how useful it is . 
a gas cooktop would be worse and a smooth cooktop probably much better . 
i love the floral design and the colors . 
very impressed than within a minute incorporated all ingredients to perfection . 
snug fit ,  with all the buttons and holes perfectly aligned . 
yes ,  it is plastic ,  but not cheap plastic . 
i use this with afresh to clean my cook top . 
doesn t get stuck on the rod like some non rollers do . 
i made flour tortillas that night for our mexican burrito dinner . 
the grill surface is easier to clean than our other grills . 
the case zipper shuts with a flap that covers the zipped part . 
i feel like i have a new phone . 
it grinds it to a powder in just a couple of seconds . 
plus its from amazon and amazon wouldn t put their name on crap . 
another thing i really like is that it does not have rivets . 
he read every amazon . com review as well as the zojirushi website . 
fair price . x x x x x x x x xx x . 
i have to say that it was money well spent . 
it stores in a really small place and is built to last . 
saves on cleaning and the use of aluminum foil . 
what a change in my life this will make . 
this is the second one of these i have purchased . 
it doesn t require genius to get this unit operating . 
carrots will leave a big orange smear on the surface . 
the instructions came over the motorola num_extend and were very clear . 
once the lid closes ,  the smell goes away . 
it s not as bulky feel as the other cases available . 
still it is a fun learning experience and so far so good . 
it was just what i expected it to be . 
i did not have what i felt were unrealistic expectations of this device . 
my wife despises window fans usually and she loves this thing too . 
i purchased the frieling to replace a glass bodum press that broke . 
it works as expected and is just the right size for the camper . 
a meeting my phone is in the bag charging . 
white in the refrigerator a couple of days longer . 
i love cooking and you need sharp knives when cooking . 
this item works just as i thought it would . 
it comes at a good price and appears to be well made . 
i read all the reviews and decided on this one . 
of course the german s call this sort of idea good engineering . 
i also love that this griddle doubles as an indoor grill . 
we have used ours at least a couple of hundred times . 
a must have if you have one of the older foodsavers . 
i may even give some as gifts this holiday season . 
the finer the setting ,  the longer it takes . 
i use these reviews so heavily that i want to give back . 
should have a wider design for different foods . 
its actually a little better than the filter that came with the unit . 
purchased this to charge my new android tablet in the car on trips . 
this is the best cookware i ve ever owned . 
not that anything sticks that much you just don t have to worry .
