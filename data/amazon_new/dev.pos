they gave me a week to see if any more problems popped up . 
a year and a half with two kids and no casualties so far . 
the price was right and it came very quickly after i ordered it . 
the sound is alright but they are good because they block outside sounds .

the light indicators for the battery life and connection status are wonderful . 
i bought this one because the original cable i had was ripping apart .

i have had my cuisinart machine for num_extend years . 
i mounted some cambridge soundworks surround speakers on the stands with no problems .

charges my nokia num_extend at a fairly fast rate . 
excellent peeler ! so many peelers just don t work that well .

this pan is a wonderful addition to my calphalon collection . 
the powerful motor is more than enough for any job . 
it s had the best crema on my espresso this side of italy . 
the sound quality is amazing for music and phone conversations . 
don t put in ear while crazy glue is wet . 
only a percolator perfectionist would really notice that difference . 
after that i gave the slicer another chance . 
highly recommend these to people to use on their whiteboards or refrigerators . 
this was a really good price for the cord . 
sometimes i have to keep mobile in dusty places . 
it eliminates sediment and any traces of bitterness . 
this one was at a great price and it works well . 
that s the only reason i didn t give it five stars . 
i personally have no need for a kickstand so this works great . 
we have used it every day for a month . 
would recommend it to anyone who s a user of ram mount products . 
upon switching to the iphone num_extend it has continued to work .

no soap or abrasive cleaners of any kind . 
i m glad when i did ,  i chose a boos . 
it fits all jars perfectly and cans well . 
protects my phone and it s simple to put on and take off . 
so i decided to get myself a second one .

much cheaper than the apple version and works just as well . 
haven t dropped it yet ,  so hopefully it will hold up . 
i have the time and the inclination to can again . 
i love that i can take it from vehicle to vehicle with me . 
i am happy with the order and you will be too .

each glass size ended being exactly what i like . 
great versatility with the usb port that could charge any device . 
over num_num years ago i used a pressure cooker on a regular basis . 
i use this in between with just hot water . 
thanks to the seller for sending me a quality  new  product . 
nice design ,  easy to assemble and decent quality . 
about this product because of the low price . 
i ve heard they are great with repairs if you need one . 
the only thing better would have been getting a new mixer . 
to be honest ,  i m pretty neutral about these . 
this is a very nice pepper grinder in a sea of junk grinders . 
it works great for reheating soup or making instant oatmeal . 
and is the best quality cast iron cookware made . 
great coffee maker and very easy to use . 
first i like that the whole chassis is stainless steel . 
practical and ingenious ,  we use it all the time . 
it recharges quickly and i make sure it s always ready to go . 
these arrived and are a little short but they work perfectly . 
these make nice gifts that won t break the bank . 
i will not have my iphone until april . 
i won t take a star away just for preference . 
i own several timers and this is my favorite . 
works perfectly and much better than non htc charger on my hct phone . 
the audio is great and people never complain about not hearing me . 
excellent num_extend stars instead of num_num because of the price . 
it s also a bit heaver then normal headphones because of the batteries . 
this is one that the quality was just as sweet as the quantity . 
i bought this for my motorola droid num_extend
it turns out that making yogurt is easy; just follow the included directions . 
that s just the nature of cast iron cookware . 
it has never failed to open what i needed opened . 
i recommend them to anyone needing great value for the money . 
i bought this otterbox case because the defender is too bulky . 
and the steel just didn t conduct the heat to my satisfaction . 
otherwise i can find no fault with the cup . 
this is compact ,  and does a good job of grinding . 
this was a cheap solution to my problem . 
arrived undamaged and no broken wire like other reviewers stated . 
i use it mainly for preparing coffee beans for storage . 
i have used this while sitting in a deer stand charging num_num iphones . 
this shaker is all glass and stainless steel . 
it replaces parchment paper and it is washable and reusable . 
within a year the plastic tube on the shredding disk began to break . 
it reminds me of my grandma and my childhood days on the farm . 
access to the volume and power buttons is not at all obstructed . 
it works amazingly and stands up to a lot of abuse . 
two minutes in my microwave and i have a big bowl of popcorn . 
i bought this item to listen to much while i ran . 
it cooks everything evenly and it gets that perfectly done color . 
that stand is locked in there quite well . 
for normal phone tasks ,  the boxwave works great . 
i just wish acrylic had a few more products along this line . 
love all the color cases for such a cheap price . 
i can pop it off and clean it easily . 
over time i ve become a fan of oxo products . 
i put any delicate items that need to be washed . 
the result ,  i m not wasting gallons of water . 
now my phone will last for a while when i am traveling . 
this device does both of those actions quickly . 
you really can t go wrong for this price . 
this is exactly the same as the one it replaced and works perfectly . 
much more workable for me in our apartment than an outdoor barbeque . 
my iphone num_extend connected instantly the first time i turned this on . 
it does not rotate in every direction like the comparably priced starbucks machine . 
thanks amazon and the manufacturer for good packing and quick shipping . 
on it s high heat setting ,  it uses only num_num watts . 
the resultant edges are smooth enough not to easily cut you . 
calphalon has become my favorite brand of cookware . 
overall ,  i got exactely what i expected which is perfect . 
i searched long and hard to find a quality charger for my phone . 
ok ,  this is like the third time i have rated this . 
it s effective  clear  range is appx num_num feet . 
these were significantly cheaper than the cast aluminum pan . 
i love my knives and this is fast becoming a favorite . 
this pan is the perfect size for my household . 
this makes that particular part difficult to clean . 
the first is a two piece hard shell that snaps around the ipod . 
the can opener ,  also cuts down on effort . 
otherwise this works amazingly well in a variety of different sized pots . 
plastic very sturdy and holds up well to the microwave heat . 
we have the older model of these delonghi radiator heaters from a relative . 
i also found that it had a pretty long battery life . 
i am using a rooted and modded inspire num_extend
we totally love its versibility to mount is various areas . 
i suggest you give it as a gift . 
this kitchenaid unit was purchased to make ice cream . 
the cable the samsung facinate comes with allways came loose . 
i have another set from different brand but these are my favorites . 
i foresee the vacuum being released like the other reviewers mentioned . 
a little more work to clean up after . 
this is probably the best bb for the money . 
much better price than williams sonoma and other high end cooking shops . 
i have two small children ,  perhaps enough said but . 
keep charged batteries for spares when your battery goes dead . 
i really enjoy these with my wok cooking . 
this is a plastic shamppoer and the pieces dont install well . 
use small amounts and use the shake method after salting . 
i hang the from a hook in the kitchen . 
i am going to try and interrupt the cycle to make pizza dough . 
another plus is that it is reasonably light for its size . 
the icarrier is another well built battery by them . 
it took me a few applications before i got good at it . 
i put this in a upstairs room to circulate the air up there . 
it has increased my water intake easily a hundred fold . 
but i have other spatulas for when i need a straight edge . 
this headset was purchased to replace a jabra num_extend
it is beautiful with a smooth ,  shiny finish . 
the phone began to freeze on phone calls and camera gallery .

the same goes for beef and pork roasts . 
i use it when i clean the outside refrig . 
i expect to use these dishes for the rest of my life . 
this is my third attempt at a thermal carafe . 
i use this vent mount with my samsung galaxy nexus and my ipod . 
i had to season the press ,  but that was easy . 
it can also be pressed into service as a last line of defense . 
like i said ,  it is not really steam . 
it is very sharp ad makes peeling very easy . 
keep the phone clean and had no problem with it . 
my num_extend fits perfectly with the protective skin on it . 
i bought it because it is the meat pounder alton brown recommended . 
the domed lid is perfect to keep things from splattering . 
i use these in my overhead flexible four inch system for dust control . 
this machine works well for me and is a breeze to clean . 
i just wipe them off with a damp cloth to clean . 
some people bash the back battery cover which is a thin plastic cover . 
i recommend it to all of my friends that have carpet . 
volume buttons are a little hard to get to but not to bad . 
wow ,  for the price it s a really good cable . 
these are great screen protecters and look very nice . 
these kitchen shears rock and are in heavy rotation in my kitchen . 
we re impressed with this line and are likely to buy more . 
these classic knifes are exactly what i expected . 
i don t have that fear with the vent mounting . 
update :  obviously i caved in and got the num_extend anyway . 
i have purchased glass lids for many of my pots ,  etc . 
i discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged . 
the glass protectors are catching on ,  check one out . 
they are fabulous and indespensable if you are a cook . 
this is really a great buy for about $
i had solid ones before with no rollers . 
i like to make water with fruit in it . 
would highly recommend for anyone wanting to grill inside . 
recommended for anyone who wants to save money . 
it keeps the square shape of the iphone without being too bulky . 
but ,  hey what do you expect for a num_num mah beast . 
if not for this ,  i d have given it five stars . 
the long handle makes it top heavy when trying to rest it somewhere . 
there are far more positive reviews than negative reviews !  . 
thanks so very much for an awesome case . 
it dust doesn t have the width to turn those bigger items well . 
this pressure cooker is a welcome addition to my kitchen . 
there are also belt loops but i have not used them yet . 
if you make big batches ,  get a big cuisinart . 
i can t wait to get home and try the bagel dough recipe . 
makes a good cup of coffee and does it reasonably quickly . 
it fits perfectly and i like how it is hugs my phone . 
great buy !  i love to decorate my bb . 
this one will be coming out much more frequently . 
the smaller plates are great for toast in the mornings . 
we were so happy that amazon carried this . 
hope this helps someone get a better idea of the product . 
i bought this as my wife has developed a taste for guacamole dip . 
thinking of ordering some as gifts for my friends who also have iphones . 
not really enough to leave a huge residue but a puff . 
glass is thick and durable and fits nicely in the wire frame . 
very good price also as the same item at verizon costs almost num_extend
i unscrewed the fuse cap to reveal a tiny glass type fuse . 
a plastic blade guard would be a nice addition . 
couldnt be that much harder to add it . 
bought these to fight the glare from lights and being outside . 
took me two tries but they work nicely . 
plus i ve found it to be very accurate . 
my fiancee picked it out and she loves it . 
use plastic wrap or simple napkin over them and no problems . 
bought as a gift after having the griffin num_extend amps car charger . 
it s pretty thin so just take care of it . 
i will keep an eye out for more to add to my collection . 
they clean up in the dishwasher easily too . 
very happy with this new addition to my kitchen . 
it worked great in my car and charged my phone quickly . 
these were ok ,  didn t like real small ones . 
it s easy to install due to the slight stretch in the plastic . 
have used filter pitchers and this is much easier to use . 
the straight sides allow for a cake that will be even and beautiful . 
the background noise cancellation on this thing is the top of the line . 
the three wand attachments are great for their specified purposes . 
fits neatly over your appliance with smoothly contoured lines . 
my phone runs hot while charging ,  however it does charge . 
all you have to to is clear the cache . 
i like that the cord can be concealed in the base . 
however you want to get that ,  its up to you . 
the guard stays put for a long time . 
i was actually pretty impressed with the sound quality of these headphones . 
just wanted to say i was pleasantly surprised when i received this today . 
we looked at several of these devices to gut a pineapple . 
after years of constant use it shows no sign of dulling . 
it is so convenient we ll live with that issue . 
she says it protects her phone from being damaged if she drops it . 
a sony ericcson may be the phone for you . 
juicer looks great ,  and is very well made . 
the price of the item well surpasses any hangups one might have . 
this is one of those items that delivers everything it promises . 
love this pan for cooking for a crowd or making sheet cakes . 
this steamer has two compartments which will hold enough veggies for a family of num_extend
either they do not fit properly ,  or they do not last . 
this one is being used at least weekly . 
however ,  it is a bit difficult to clean . 
i was a bit skeptical of the practicality of this . 
i m dieting so i use an airpopper a lot . 
i could drive and get coffee faster than that . 
the machine was perfect  ,  it works like a dream . 
you need to balance size ,  cost and power . 
however ,  i m told there is significant noise at highway speed . 
the charger worked fine for a month ,  then just stopped working . 
your phone is protected without a lot of additional bulk . 
this is a fine mug for teachers ,  business people etc . 
the tea is still burn your mouth hot . 
i look at my kitchen stuff almost like a pet lol . 
i like to make very large batches of soup . 
the knife blades slide in and protects the blade . 
i moved into the suburbs where the water is so much better . 
i m not sure if that s my area or the phone itself . 
it moves air quite fast for its size . 
this is an awesome product ,  if only in appearance . 
we ve had this pan for a few years now . 
still ,  knowing what i know now i would purchase it again . 
however i wish the sides were a bit higher on the outside . 
it is curved and it helps shape the loaf . 
this is not just for paella and mussels . 
i would recommend this paddle to any of my friends . 
so i am experimenting with taking filling out . 
i especially love the built in strainers in the lid . 
you can never have too many usb chargers . 
the quality for the price of this pan is awesome . 
washes reall nice in the dishwasher with no discoler attion . 
very small footprint on the counter as well . 
really nice ,  sturdy measuring cups with good grips . 
have been needing one for awhile and decided to buy this one . 
the best thing about this is that food doesn t stain the inside . 
for the average kitchen i suspect this would last a lifetime . 
this was a great replacement for our bodum french press . 
saves your hands from getting cut and lids dropping in your food . 
so in the future we will share one . 
it is sleek looking and it cleans up very well . 
using it to charge my galaxy num_extend right now . 
it fell and scooped right underneath the egg . 
were it not for my glasses ,  it would be perfect . 
one gratin recipe called for num_num grated potatoes . 
these are hard to find in local stores . 
i must say that i love every one of them . 
i can t say enough good things about this great lid . 
i wish it would just beep until i shut it off . 
they also appear to be better made and more durable . 
all the rest is good . the phone is terrific as a phone . 
so i don t worry about warping or discoloration of the handle . 
if you prefer russets ,  cut them in half or even quarters . 
we use this every morning making our espresso . 
this charger works well considering it is not an actually apple product . 
keeps food warm and i am using it regularly . 
all of my other tongs don t hold the food as well . 
does exactly what you would expect it to do . 
i gave it num_num stars because i had to return the first on . 
lids fit perfect after several washings in the dishwasher top shelf  . 
i took a key to it and it still looks great . 
music and speech are rendered really ,  really well . 
you will ask yourself how did i ever live without this great mixer . 
i ve has the num_extend model for num_num months and it is great . 
keeps our counters looking more neat and organized . 
i use it everyday and its been great . 
this headset is exactly as described by the manufacturer . 
my husband has num_num cup of french press in the mornings . 
great for slicing where surface tension is high and inner stability threatened . 
having the right tools makes any task easier . 
perfect ,  well build and also perfectly fit all kinds of gismoz . 
ok ,  i m with everybody when it comes to this tray . 
it heats fast and is very efficient in heating . 
they work great and especially for frying chicken to searing steaks . 
thank goodness for amazon !  i found the exact match . 
we got this after our old beater began to flake off . 
besides that it has been a great case . 
considering the above ,  it s well worth this price . 
bought these because of plans to take cakes to fund raisers . 
not too big or too small but just right . 
i think they ll last as long as i want them around . 
and the retractable cord is also a very nice feature . 
we are back to buy another cordless vacuum . 
but you can use paper filters in this machine if you want to . 
it looks as good as it did when i first got it . 
great for slow cooking baby food and for dips at a great price . 
i wish i would have had this when i was single . 
they seem to be pretty accurate and durable as well . 
i cant believe how much hair and dust it picked up . 
but i can t say that i really like popcorn without that butter . 
it s great because of it s heavy duty material . 
everyone heard me clearly and i heard them clearly . 
the cradle is snapped onto the mount and is ready for use . 
work well as a serving bowl or as a soup bowl . 
the parts were perfect and fit together easily . 
they clean easy ,  lightweight and take no space to store upright . 
i used num_num grams of flour to num_num eggs for my pasta dough . 
but i wasn t that impressed with it after my first use .
